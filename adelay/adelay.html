<h2>Description</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The <tt>adelay</tt> utility is an audio signal delay analyzer.  It
reads the data from the input device or a file, calculates correlation
between the two channels using FFT, and reports the delay between them. 

<p>In correlation, we compare two sets of data directly superposed, and
with one of them shifted left or right.  The relation that holds when
two functions, <i>g(t)</i> and <i>h(t)</i>, are interchanged is: 
<center>
Corr<i>(g,h)(t)</i> = Corr<i>(h,g)(-t)</i>
</center>

<p>The discrete correlation of two sampled functions
<i>g<sub>k</sub></i> and <i>h<sub>k</sub></i>, each periodic with period
<i>N</i>, is defined by
<center>
Corr<i>(g,h)[j]</i> = Sum [<i>k</i>=0 to <i>N</i>-1](<i>g[j+k]</i> + <i>h[k]</i>) 
</center>
The discrete correlation theorem says that this discrete correlation of
two real functions <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> is one member of the
discrete Fourier transform pair
<center>
Corr<i>(g,h)[j]</i> <==> <i>G<sub>k</sub>H<sub>k</sub>*</i>
</center>

<p>We can compute correlation using an FFT as follows:  compute the FFT
for the two data sets, multiply one resulting transform by the complex
conjugate of the other, and compute the inverse transform of the
product.  The result, say <i>r</i>, will formally be a complex vector of
length <i>N</i> with all its imaginary parts zero since the original
data sets were both real.  The components of <i>r</i> are the values of
the correlation at different lags. 

<p>When the delay is more then half of the length of the collected
sample, the results tend to vary.  Normally, more than half of them are
correct.  Most incorrect results fluctuate near 0 (no delay) as the two
set of data are considered unrelated.  Specify larger sampling time if
results jump between a long delay and 0.

<h2>Options</h2>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>-h</tt>
<td valign=top>Print a short description of the usage.

<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>-d</tt>
<td valign=top>Print out decoded data in addition to the correlation when -o is
specified. 

<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>-e PCMU|PCMA|L16</tt>
<td valign=top>Specify the encoding of the audio input.  Currently, delay supports
PCMU (U-law), PCMA (A-law) and L16 (Linear 16-bit signed).  The default
encoding is L16.  This option has no effect when reading from file
because the file header provides encoding information. 

<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>-f</tt> <i>samplerate</i>
<td valign=top>Sampling frequency in Hz.  The default is 8000 Hz.  This option has
no effect when reading from file because the file header provides frequency
information. 

<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>-p</tt> <i>period</i>
<td valign=top>Period for checking delay.  When reading data from audio input
device, the program can check the delay periodically.  The default is 60
sec.  Use 0 or less to suppress looping (run only once).  This option
has no effect when reading from file because the program is only run
once in that case. 

<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>-s</tt> <i>skip</i>
<td valign=top>Skip first seconds of data when reading from file.  The default is
0.  This option has no effect when reading from audio input device. 

<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>-t</tt> <i>time</i>
<td valign=top>Sampling time in seconds.  The default is 2 seconds.  The FFT
library requires the size of the data set to be power of 2.  Therefore,
the delay program automatically reads in data of length that is power of
2 and just above the specified length.  If the delay is larger than the
half of the sampling length, the results tend to vary.  Normally, more
than half of them are correct.  Most incorrect results fluctuate near 0
(no delay) as the two set of data are considered unrelated.  Specify
larger sampling time if results jump between long time and 0. 

<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>-i</tt> <i>in</i>
<td valign=top>Read from the given audio file.  The file must be a Sun audio (.au)
file.  By default, the program reads from audio input device. Reading
from the audio device is currently only supported for Sun systems.

<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>-o</tt> <i>out</i>
<td valign=top>Output the delay correlation pairs to file out.  Use "-" for stdout. 
By default, this program does not output this data.  This option has no
effect if this program loops for checking delay from audio input device.

<h2>Output</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>This program simply print out the delay between the two channels.

<p>When the <tt>-o</tt> option is specified, the output has following format: 
<pre>
Lag (msec)      Correlation 
-1024.000000    -1.408000e+03 
-1023.875000    -2.560000e+02 
-1023.750000    1.220000e+02 
</pre>
<p>If, in addition to the <tt>-o</tt> option, the <tt>-d</tt> option is
also specified, the output is in following format: 
<pre>
Lag (msec)      Correlation     Left Channel    Right Channel 
-1024.000000    -1.408000e+03   0.000000e+00    0.000000e+00 
-1023.875000    -2.560000e+02   0.000000e+00    0.000000e+00 
-1023.750000    1.220000e+02    0.000000e+00    0.000000e+00 
</pre>

</blockquote>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<blockquote>
Reads from a recorded audio file "data.au" and analyze delay:
<pre>
  delay -i data.au
</pre>
Reads from a recorded audio file "data.au", analyzes delay, and 
print out the correlation to file "result":
<pre>
  delay -i data.au -o result
</pre>
Reads from a recorded audio file "data.au", analyzes delay, print 
out the correlation along with decoded data to standard output, 
and observe them with pager: 
<pre>
  delay -d -i data.au -o - | more 
</pre>
Reads from the audio input device with all default values:
<pre>
  delay
</pre>
Reads from the audio input device, calculates only once:
<pre>
  delay -p 0
</pre>
Reads from the audio input device with U-law encoding:
<pre>
  delay -e PCMU
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Exit Status</h2>

<blockquote>
The following exit values are returned:

<table>
<tr>
<td>0
<td>The program terminated successfully.

<tr>
<td>>0
<td>An error occurred.
</table>
</blockquote>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This program can be used to measure one-way internet delay.  Split
one audio signal into two channels, one transmitted by telephone network
and the other by internet.  The receiver connect these channels to the
audio input of the computer, the first channel to the left and the
second to the right.  The result from the program is then the one-way
internet delay compared to the telephone switch network transmission.
