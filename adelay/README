Project:	Audio Delay

System Requirement

	The package is developed on Columbia CS SUN Sparc stations.
Two libraries must be present.  The first is the netutil library of
Prof. Henning Schulzrinne's research group.  The default directory is
/u/kon/hgs/src/nevot/sun5.  The second is audio library provided by the
Sun demo package.  The default directory is at /usr/demo/SOUND/lib/.
Change the Makefile if the directories on your machine are different.
	The package utilizes the netutil library and its system-dependency
is limited by that library.  Currently, the package only supports U-law, 
A-law, 8-bit linear, 16-bit linear and 32-bit linear encoding (all linear
data are treated as signed).  Users can write decoding block in the 
decodeAudioData function in aufileutil.c to support other encoding if 
desired.

Installation

	Uncompress the archive with gzip and tar. Edit Makefile if 
necessary.  Type "make" and make the program delay.  To make the test 
driver for FFT library, use "make fft.t".

Usage
	Use -h option to get the options list for delay and fft.t
