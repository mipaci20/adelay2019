Abstract</H2>
The main aim of this project is to build an analyzer for measuring the
delay between the two channels of the audio input, using the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) correlation function.&nbsp; Given a signal from the phone
line and a signal transmitted over the Internet, this analyzer also provides
the ability to measure one-way delay.
<H2>
Introduction</H2>
Audio Signal Delay Analyzer is a tool to measure the delay between the
signals of the two channels in a stereo audio input.&nbsp; It decodes the
audio data, calculates the correlation between the signals of the two channels,
and report the delay.&nbsp; This analyzer can read directly from the audio
device or a recorded stereo audio file.&nbsp; The supported audio file
formats include .au, .snd and .aiff files.&nbsp; The supported audio encoding
are U-law, A-law, 8-bit linear, 16-bit linear and 32-bit linear.

<P>It has been common practice to measure round trip delay in the internet.&nbsp;
However, there has been difficult to measure the one-way delay in the internet.&nbsp;
With this analyzer, we can split one audio signal to two channels, one
transmitted by the telephone network and the other by the internet, and
measure the delay between these two channels at the receiver machine.&nbsp;
Because the transmission time by telephone network is stable, we can then
measure the one way delay from the source to the destination.
<H2>
Architecture</H2>
The delay utility is an audio signal delay analyzer.&nbsp; It reads the
data from the input device or a file, calculates correlation between the
two channels using FFT, and report the delay between them.

<P>In correlation, we compare two sets of data directly superposed, and
with one of them shifted left or right.&nbsp;&nbsp; The relation that holds
when two functions, <I>g(t) </I>and <I>h(t)</I>, are interchanged is:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corr(<I>g,h</I>)(<I>t</I>)
= Corr(<I>h,g</I>)(<I>-t</I>)
<BR>The discrete correlation of two sampled functions <I>g<SUB>k</SUB></I><SUB>
</SUB>and <I>h<SUB>k</SUB></I>, each periodic with period <I>N</I>, is
defined by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corr(<I>g,h</I>)[<I>j</I>]
= Sum[k=0 to <I>N</I>-1](<I>g</I>[<I>j</I>+<I>k</I>] + <I>h</I>[<I>k</I>])
<BR>The discrete correlation theorem says that this discrete correlation
of two real functions <I>g</I> and <I>h</I> is one member of the discrete
Fourier transform pair
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corr(<I>g,h</I>)[<I>j</I>]
&lt;==> <I>G<SUB>k</SUB>H<SUB>k</SUB></I>*
<BR>We can compute correlation using FFT as follows: FFT the two data sets,
multiply one resulting transform by the complex conjugate of the other,
and inverse transform the product.&nbsp; The result, say <I>r</I>, will
formally be a complex vector of length N with all its imaginary parts zero
since the original data sets were both real.&nbsp; The components of <I>r</I>
are the values of the correlation at different lags.

<P>The analyzer consists of the FFT library, Audio File Utility module
and the main module.
<H3>
FFT library</H3>
It performs Fast Fourier Transform for real data and calculate the correlation
between two data set.&nbsp; It is based on <I><A HREF="#1">Press &lt;1></A></I>.
<H3>
Audio File Utility Module</H3>
It utilizes the netutil library to parse the audio file header and provides
facility to print out the information about the audio file.&nbsp; It also
decodes the audio data read in from the file or the audio input device.&nbsp;
Currently, it supports U-law, A-law, 8-bit linear, 16-bit linear and 32-bit
linear.&nbsp; User can extends the capability by providing decoding block
in the decodeAudioData function.
<H3>
Main Module</H3>
The main module parses command argument and performs specified function.
<H2>
Program Documentation</H2>
The installation is very simple.&nbsp; Follow <A HREF="manual.html">this
link</A> for installation and operation.

Acknowledgment</H2>
I would like to thank Jonathan Lennox for his help and advice.&nbsp; I
would also like to thank Prof. Henning Schulzrinne for giving me this opportunity,
for his guidance, and for his kind consideration for my medical condition
during this project.
